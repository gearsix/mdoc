mdoc

A very basic wrapper around *cmark* that adds text need to build
a fully-formed HTML file. It also adds some minimal CSS styling.

	./mdoc [-t TITLE] [-a AUTHOR] < file.md > file.html

It uses `stdin` to read input data, so you'll need to pipe the
Markdown text to it (e.g. shown above). Did it like thie because
this is a quick & dirty tool.
